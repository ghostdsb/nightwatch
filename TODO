Application
|> starts world genserver
|> dynamic supervisor for players

world contains 
 - board state
    %{coordinate => %{player_pid => 1}}
 - players sends move signal to world 
    |> world broadcasts to all
 - players sends kill signal 
    |> world broadcasts kill signal to affected players

 World contains a map of coord to player_id_list
 when player_moves we remove that player_id from the list and add to the list in new coord 
 when player hits we can send kill event to pids in that list

 or

 World contains a map of coord to player_id_map
 when player_moves we drop that player_id from the map and add to the map in new coord 
 when player hits we can send kill event to pids in that map

 or 

 world has player_map (player_pid to coord)
 when player moves we update the coord in map
 when player hits we check for each player on the map

 - hit(playerid, coordinate)
 - move(playerid, from_coordinate, to_coordinate)


player
 - genserver
 - state -> 
    - status - alive/dead
    - position - coordinates
 - endpoints ->
    - get_status
    - get_position
